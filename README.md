PYRO
====

The PYRO (Planning Your Required Observations) software tool is designed to help astronomers plan observing runs and optimize target schedules.

At the moment it requires the python modules sidereal (http://infohost.nmt.edu/tcc/contrib.html/lang/python/examples/sidereal/downloads.html) and pyephem (http://rhodesmill.org/pyephem/).
